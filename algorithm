Generate Gene pool
    -> New random DNA (SAME)
    -> New fitness calculation (SAME)
    -> Append to genepool (SAME)
    
While (true)
    -> If the best fitness in the
       genepool is 0, break - found a match. (SAME)
    -> Get 2 random parents to generate a new
       child (Luisa's)
        o Crossover: Portions of BOTH parents' DNAs
          are combined into the child (Luisa's)
        o Mutation: Select a random character in the
          resulting child's DNA, and switch it to a
          different character in a change of 5,
          following its ASCII representation (SAME)
    -> If the resulting child has better fitness than
       the current worst in the genepool, replace it (SAME)
