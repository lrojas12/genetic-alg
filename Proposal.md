Our idea is to create a parallaleized brute-force password cracker. Sounds more complicated than it really is. We will generate or create a random password of known length and then create every possible combination of that length password until a match is found. Since every creation and check are mutually exclusive we can parallelize the problem. It would be cool to try it with some real world applications and see, for security reasons of course, how long it would take to actually crack one of our own passwords for example. We will run the program with a different number of threads and different unmber of password characters and compare the results. We could also collect statistics about the running threads which will involve shared variables and mutex locks. If it slows the program down too much we may have to opt out of that, but we can gage that better once we've written it. We are planning to implement this in a programming Golang (https://golang.org/) since it has built in threads and is fast similar to C. If we somehow find that the above work is too easy, we will also implement the solution in C(omp/pthreads) and compare the results of the 2 languages.
